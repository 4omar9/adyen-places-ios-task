# ios-code-sample
Initially this was an assignment done for an interview process, I have decided to repurpose it to be a generic code sample.

All the UI components are done using SwiftUI, 
Therefore please make sure you selecte "PleacesSwiftUI" target to run the project.

The project is developed under the assumption that LocationService will be allowed by the user.
